## Lab 5: Combinatorial Logic on FPGA's 

Goals of the lab were to continue practicing the implementation of combinatorial logic on the Nexys 4 DDR FPGA board. 

It was desired to make a 2x2-bit input and three output digital comparator. There are 4 digital switches used and the outputs will be three LED's and / or RGB LED's. 

## Lab 6: 7 Segment Driver 

Goals of the lab were to use verilog to code a Nexys board that will output a certain number depending on what switches are activated.
